        Hello! My name is Chip Long. I have been working as a manual software
        quality assurance engineer for the past 12 years. I started that career
        working at a third party testing house so I was able to test a very wide
        variety of software. Everything from games, to websites, to security
        programs. I have also worked briefly in the insurance world, but mostly
        the last several years have been working in FinTech on mobile banking
        solutions.
      </p>

        I currently feel I have reached about as far as I can go in the manual
        test world. I have good skills at creating test plans and writing test
        cases. Although I have helped set up automation testing for a couple of
        the products I have worked on, I have very little actual automation
        experience. I have fixed this problem by enrolling in the DU coding boot
        camp. This has taught me not only automation but also the full stack
        development. I am ready now to accept a position that is either going to
        be testing and/or developing a fullstack website.
